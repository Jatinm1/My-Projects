Expenser is an Expense Management app which is created in Java. For Front-end I have used Java swing framework and JFrame. For Back-end it is using SQL Database which I have hosted on phpMyadmin. The connection is done through JDBC.

In this application, you can add your Expenses according to the Categories to keep track of your spending.

It provides different Views on Main Page such as
• Monthly View
• Last 30 Days Spendings
• All Expenses till Date

It also have a separate Transaction View page in which you can view your transactions in a sorted manner to better analyze your spendings.
You can Sort your transactions in four different ways:
• Date - Newest to Oldest
• Date - Oldest to Newest
• Price - High to Low
• Price - Low to High

You can also view your Transactions for a particular Time-period or a Category.
